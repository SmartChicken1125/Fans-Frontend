						How do we uphold these guidelines?
					</TermsText>
					<TermsText>
						We understand that the majority of creators are
						passionate about crafting unique content for their fans.
						However, there are specific benefits that are limited.
						In determining what qualifies as a benefit, our Trust
						and Integrity team conducts a comprehensive and
						context-aware assessment to ascertain what fans are
						contributing towards and the value they derive. It's
						also crucial for us to ensure that creators are not
						bypassing our guidelines by offering disallowed benefits
						outside of FYP.Fans that aren't disclosed on FYP.Fans.
						{"\n\n"}
						Consequently, the Trust and Integrity team evaluates a
						creator's complete digital footprint when examining
						benefit levels.

						Prohibited Content and Benefits:
					</TermsText>
					<TermsText>
						Legal boundaries can be intricate, given the diverse
						laws across various countries and regions. Consequently,
						our guidelines are crafted with a global perspective,
						rather than being solely based on your specific
						location. Below are certain benefits that are strictly
						forbidden on FYP.Fans. In certain instances, we will not
						only take action against the account but will also
						collaborate with legal authorities to trace the origin.
						In instances related to minors or acts of cruelty, we
						will work with legal authorities to pursue and address
						the matter to the fullest extent of the law. The
						following benefits are strictly prohibited:
						{"\n\n"}- Visual content that exploits minors or
						showcases child maltreatment.{"\n"}- Visual
						representations of cruelty towards humans or animals.
						{"\n"}- Visual depictions of extreme violence or gore
						without educational or documentary context.{"\n"}
						-Materials that support or glorify acts of terrorism or
						extremist ideologies.{"\n"}- Visual or textual content
						that promotes or glorifies sexual assault or
						non-consensual acts.{"\n"}- Content that promotes
						dangerous or harmful challenges that could lead to
						physical harm or death.{"\n"}

						Substances, Medications, and Health Supplements
					</TermsText>
					<TermsText>
						We recognize that many individuals wish to share their
						personal journeys, detailing challenges they've
						overcome, in hopes of supporting others in similar
						situations. While we encourage such sharing, we are
						committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of our
						community. Therefore, the following cannot be offered as
						benefits on FYP.Fans:
						{"\n\n"}- Any form of illicit substances or related
						equipment.{"\n"}- Incentives, including but not limited
						to coupons or gift cards, that contribute towards the

						promise outcomes like weight reduction, energy
						enhancement, or miraculous remedies.{"\n"}- Educational
						resources or literature suggesting they possess the
						solution to curing ailments.
						{"\n"}
						{"\n"}
						It's worth noting that FYP.Fans permits content that
						delves into or debates alternative medicine, provided it
						doesn't jeopardize the safety of individuals. It's a
						nuanced distinction, but there's a clear difference
						between "Scientific exploration of CBD oil's potential
						benefits for dementia" and "Curing cancer exclusively
						with Yoga." Our team diligently monitors content that
						might lean towards the latter.

						not limited to, false claims, conspiracy theories, or

						their content and provide sources where necessary. Any
						content found to be spreading misinformation will be
