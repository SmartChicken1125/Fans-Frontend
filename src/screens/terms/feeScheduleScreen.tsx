						{"\n"}- Purchases (fans): 7%
						{"\n"}- Gem purchases (fans): 10%

						Payment Processing Fees
					</TermsText>
					<TermsText>
						We use Stripe and PayPal for tips. We use Authorize.net
						for subscription payment processing. These fees cover
						the cost of recurring billing, fraud prevention, and
						payment recovery.
						{"\n\n"}- Stripe: 2.9% + 0.30USD {"\n"}- PayPal: 3.9% +
						0.30USD
						{"\n"}- Authorize.net: 2.9% + 30¢

						Currency Conversion Fees
					</TermsText>

						Payout Fees
					</TermsText>
					<TermsText>
						Your account balance already reflects the deduction of
						platform fees, payment processing fees, and currency
						conversion fees. Additional fees are incurred when
						transferring your balance from your FYP.Fans account.
						{"\n\n"}- Bank Payout: 1% of the amount transferred with
						a minimum of $0.25, capped at $20.00 USD
						{"\n\n"}
						Payouts in Other Currencies If you are receiving payouts
						in a currency other than USD, additional fees may apply.
