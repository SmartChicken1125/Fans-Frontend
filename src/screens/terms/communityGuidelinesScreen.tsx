						Spam and Community Etiquette:
					</TermsText>
					<TermsText>
						Overview: While building a fan base can be challenging,
						spamming is not the solution. Be innovative and genuine,
						avoid posting repetitive comments, and refrain from
						sending unsolicited messages to community members.
						{"\n\n"}
						Actions considered as spamming on FYP.Fans include:
						{"\n\n"}- Creating pledge schemes or contacting other
						creators for reciprocal pledge agreements.{"\n"}- Using
						FYP.Fans to distribute malware or phishing schemes.
						{"\n"}- Posting misleading content to attract fans.
						{"\n"}- Commenting on other creators' pages to promote
						your own.
						{"\n"}- Sending bulk unsolicited messages soliciting
						support.{"\n"}- Misusing tags to manipulate search
						results.{"\n"}- Posting multiple paid posts daily for
						per-post creators.{"\n"}
						{"\n"}
						{"\n"}
						When assessing spam reports, we differentiate between
						commercial spam and benign over-enthusiasm, such as
						genuine creators excessively posting on others' pages.
						If benign over-enthusiasm is identified, the account
						will be flagged; repeated violations will result in
						account removal. Accounts that are not genuine creators
						and engage in commercial spamming will be removed. In
						essence, be original and creative; no one appreciates
						spam (including the canned variety).

						Bullying, Harassment, and Threats
					</TermsText>
					<TermsText>
						Overview: FYP.Fans is dedicated to fostering a secure
						environment for its diverse community. While we champion
						freedom of expression, critical discussions, and debates
						on controversial topics, we strictly prohibit any form
						of bullying or harassment.
						{"\n\n"}
						Discussing public figures, media, or celebrities might
						entail stringent criticism, which we recognize as a
						vital component of open discourse. However, we draw a
						clear boundary against harassing private individuals or
						any actions jeopardizing physical safety, irrespective
						of the individual's public or private status.
						{"\n\n"}
						We advocate for open dialogue, but it's paramount that
						every user feels safe expressing their views without
						fear. Even contentious discussions should be approached
						respectfully. Here's our stance on these behaviors:
						{"\n\n"}- Bullying and Harassment: Intimidation, either
						directly or by leveraging influence, is unacceptable.
						Real-life confrontations are treated with heightened
						seriousness compared to online interactions due to
						potential physical harm implications. While public
						figure disputes might be viewed differently, FYP.Fans
						strictly prohibits content featuring non-consensual
						intimate imagery. However, content related to survival
						stories, educational resources, or advocacy concerning
						non-consensual intimate imagery is allowed.
						{"\n\n"}- Threats: Every member of FYP.Fans should be
						able to voice their opinions without posing threats. We
						have a stringent stance against threats of violence. Any
						user found threatening another's well-being will face
						consequences. This encompasses behaviors like stalking
						or inciting violence.

						If you're subjected to such behavior and your safety is

						Prohibition of Harmful Content:
						{"\n\n"}
						FYP.Fans is deeply committed to ensuring the safety and
						dignity of all individuals, both within and beyond our
						community. In alignment with this commitment, our
						platform maintains a stringent policy against content
						that could be harmful, offensive, or illegal.
						Specifically, we prohibit any content that glorifies,
						sensationalizes, or in any way endorses harmful sexual
						practices or behaviors. This includes, but is not
						limited to:
						{"\n\n"}
						1. Sexual Violence: Any depiction of sexual violence,
						including implied or explicit acts of non-consensual
						sexual acts, is strictly forbidden. This extends to any
						content that might trivialize or normalize such acts,
						which are not only illegal but deeply harmful to
						individuals and society.
						{"\n\n"}
						2. Bestiality: We strictly prohibit any content
						involving sexual acts with animals.
						{"\n\n"}
						3. Rape and Non-Consensual Acts: Our platform has zero
						tolerance for content that depicts, suggests, or alludes
						to rape or any other non-consensual sexual acts. We are
						committed to promoting a culture of consent and respect,
						and as such, any content that undermines these values is
						strictly prohibited.
						{"\n\n"}
						4. Child Exploitation: Protecting minors is of utmost
						importance to us. Therefore, any content that exploits
						children, either directly or indirectly, is strictly
						forbidden. This includes any sexualized depiction of
						minors or content that could be construed as promoting
						or endorsing child exploitation.
						{"\n\n"}
						5. Extreme Sexual Fetishes: While we respect the
						diversity of sexual expression, certain extreme sexual
						fetishes that involve harm, non-consent, or illegal
						activities are not permitted on our platform. This
						includes content that may involve harmful or dangerous
						practices, or that blurs the lines with non-consensual
						acts.
						{"\n\n"}
						We understand that some of these topics can appear in
						artistic, educational, or narrative contexts. In such
						cases, our Trust and Safety team will review the content
						carefully, considering the broader context and intent.
						However, our overarching commitment to safety and
						legality will guide all decisions.
						{"\n\n"}- We assess content based on its context and
						reserve the right to remove accounts that breach our
						guidelines.
						{"\n\n"}
						ID Verification and Tagging:{"\n"}- ID verification is

						Doxing and Personal Privacy
					</TermsText>
					<TermsText>
						Overview: FYP.Fans firmly opposes doxing, which entails
						disclosing someone's confidential details or compiling
						their public data to intimidate or harass them.
						{"\n\n"}
						Doxing is a tool often used to suppress or threaten
						individuals with differing online perspectives. It can
						inflict profound emotional distress and jeopardize the
						victim's physical safety. Classic doxing involves
						revealing someone's private details, such as their phone
						number or residential address. The definition of
						"private" can vary, sometimes meaning information that's
						merely challenging to locate. We also classify the
						aggregation of someone's non-private details as doxing.
						For instance, combining a person's profile picture with
						their real name, all known social media handles, and
						their city of residence would be considered doxing. The
						context of information sharing is crucial. If data seems
						to be shared to facilitate mass harassment, it's likely
						deemed doxing. Doxing doesn't promote dialogue; it
						silences voices. It hinders our capacity for
						constructive discourse, personal growth, and maintaining
						a safe disagreement environment.

						Hate Speech
					</TermsText>
					<TermsText>
						Overview: FYP.Fans serves as a bridge connecting
						creators with fans globally. Our foundation is built on
						nurturing creativity, making inclusivity our core
						principle. Consequently, FYP.Fans strictly prohibits
						content endorsing hate speech, including calls for
						violence, exclusion, or discrimination. This encompasses
						attacks based on race, ethnicity, nationality, religion,
						gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability,
						medical conditions, caste, or immigration status.
						{"\n\n"}
						When evaluating potential hate speech violations, we
						consider:{"\n"}- Is there an incitement of violence
						based on the aforementioned characteristics?{"\n"}- Does
						the user employ dehumanizing language based on these
						traits?{"\n"}- Are racial slurs or derogatory depictions
						being used?{"\n"}- Is there a mockery or denial of
						significant hate crimes, like the Holocaust?{"\n"}- Is
						the content discriminatory towards individuals based on
						immigration status or merely discussing immigration
						policies?{"\n"}- Is the content a genuine critique of a
						state or institution, or is it veiled hate speech using
						coded language?{"\n"}
						{"\n"}
						{"\n"}
						This isn't an exhaustive list, but it provides insight
						into our approach towards complex intersections of
						speech and action. Distinguishing between political
						commentary and hate speech can be nuanced. If you
						encounter potential hate speech on FYP.Fans, we urge you
						to report it.

						disassociates from a harmful or hateful group and wishes
						to fund a project adhering to FYP.Fans guidelines, we'll

						Guidelines are applicable to both creators and fans.
						While we empower creators to oversee their communities,
						there are situations where the Trust and Safety team
						will evaluate reports concerning fans' conduct.
						{"\n\n"}
						Our Trust and Safety team meticulously examines reports
						related to hate speech, harassment, and solicitation.
						Actions will be taken against a fan account if it
						breaches these guidelines. Creators can directly report
						inappropriate posts by fans using the provided
						instructions. Rest assured, our review process remains
						confidential. If you ever feel threatened due to
						stalking or harassment by a fan, it's crucial to seek
						assistance from local law enforcement and the nearest
						cybercrime unit. They possess the necessary tools and
						expertise to assist. FYP.Fans will collaborate
						diligently with law enforcement during any investigation
						and in response to any legal requests.
						{"\n\n"}
						Financial Advice Content: FYP.Fans prioritizes the
						safety of both creators and fans. We urge those
						consuming financial advice content to consult with
						certified financial experts before making any investment
						choices.
						{"\n\n"}
						Chargebacks: Chargebacks occur when individuals, in the
						case of FYP.Fans, fans, approach their banks or
						financial institutions to dispute a transaction. To
						safeguard creators, FYP.Fans will assess excessive or
						potentially deceitful chargebacks and may temporarily
						restrict fans from supporting additional creators during
						this evaluation. If a fan's chargebacks are determined
						to be fraudulent, FYP.Fans reserves the right to suspend
						or terminate their account.
						{"\n\n"}

						link. These policies are integrated into FYP.Fans' Terms
						of Use. For further details, reach out to us at
