						{"\n\n"}
						Platform fee: A flat fee and/or percentage of
						successfully processed payments taken from the creator;
						{"\n\n"}
						Payment processing fee: a percentage of successfully
						processed payments (may vary with different payment

						fans, recovering chargebacks and ensuring fraud

						are due. We treat all creator income as “Goods or

						any income that you make on FYP.Fans to the appropriate
						tax authorities, paying any relevant taxes and complying
						with the tax laws of your jurisdiction.{"\n"} There are
						a number of other taxes around the world that we are
						responsible for paying, including what is called the VAT
						tax (referred to as the Value Added Tax or Goods and

						need to use a good faith effort to select which benefit
						category they assign to memberships, offers, etc. to
						assist us in complying with applicable tax laws. You
						agree to provide accurate information when using
						FYP.Fans tools and to provide us with any additional
