						security. We also implement advanced security features
						like two-factor authentication, CAPTCHA verification for
						suspicious activities, and IP address monitoring. We
						freeze accounts that have potential high-risk patterns
						of Fraud or Chargebacks with advanced rate-limiting
						systems. All traffic between you and FYP.Fans is
						encrypted using HTTPS.
