						Parties listed on sanctions registries such as OFAC’s
						Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) List or Foreign
						Sanctions Evaders (FSE) List.
						{"\n\n"}
						To safeguard our community, we employ various strategies
						to ensure compliance, including:
						{"\n\n"}- Restricting access to FYP.Fans from sanctioned
						territories.{"\n"}- Generally disallowing creators from
						offering perks or benefits that originate from
						restricted areas.{"\n"}- Potentially requiring
						additional information from you or requesting that you

						restriction or economic sanction, we reserve the right
						to suspend, terminate, or take other appropriate actions
						concerning your account.

						Additional Considerations

					<TermsText>
						Other nations may impose their own trade restrictions,
						and certain goods may be prohibited from export or
						import under international laws. It is your
						responsibility to be aware of these laws when engaging
						in international transactions. For legal guidance,
						consult a qualified expert.
						{"\n\n"}

						programs and may block transactions in accordance with
						those programs. FYP.Fans has no influence over the
						independent decisions made by these providers.
