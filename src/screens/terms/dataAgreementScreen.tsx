						Data Handling Commitment - Safeguarding Creator Privacy
					</TermsText>
					<TermsText>
						Last updated: August 20th, 2023
						{"\n\n"}
						Our platform empowers content creators ("Creators") to
						establish subscription-based relationships by directly
						engaging their most committed followers, who then become
						paying subscribers ("Fans").
						{"\n\n"}
						To make this direct engagement with Fans possible and
						ensure the execution of membership benefits and
						commitments, we share Fans’ personal information
						("Member Information") with Creators. It is the
						responsibility of Creators to manage this Member
						Information for delivering all products or services
						included as part of their subscription-based
						relationship on our platform (commonly referred to as
						"Subscription Services"). Creators are mandated to
						adhere to this Data Handling Commitment ("Privacy
						Pledge") to uphold the privacy rights of Fans during the
						processing of Member Information.
						{"\n\n"}
						This Privacy Pledge takes effect immediately upon the
						creation of a Creator account and pertains solely to the
						Member Information gathered by our platform and shared
						with Creators for the aim of managing a
						subscription-based relationship.
						{"\n\n"}
						This Privacy Pledge serves as an extension to our
						platform's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, laying
						out the specific obligations Creators must observe while
						managing Member Information during and after their
						engagement with our platform.

						statutes, and guidelines concerning the privacy and
						handling of personal information that are applicable in
						any given jurisdiction. This includes, but is not
						limited to, the European Union’s General Data Protection
						Regulation (GDPR), as well as any legislation that
						modifies, replaces, or consolidates these rules.
						{"\n\n"}- Best Industry Practices: Denotes the exercise
						of a level of skill, knowledge, and judgment, and the
						use of resources comparable to what is generally
						expected from a professional who: (a) is competent and
						experienced in delivering the services under
						consideration, endeavors in good faith to meet
						contractual commitments and to minimize liability
						arising from any applicable duty of care; (b)
						demonstrates reasonable and diligent care in performing
						duties; and (c) adheres to Data Privacy Laws.
						{"\n\n"}- Data-Related Terms: The phrases "data
						controller", "data processor", “subprocessor”, "data
						subject", "personal data", "processing", and "adequate
						security and management measures" are defined in line
						with Directive 95/46/EC, or other relevant Data Privacy
						Laws in the jurisdiction in question.

						II. Scope of Data Management
					</TermsText>
					<TermsText>
						Both parties concur that our platform serves as the Data
						Controller, whereas the Creator assumes the role of Data
						Processor regarding Member Information managed in the
						process of delivering Subscription Services. The
						specifics of the data processing—including the kind of
						personal data being processed and the classifications of
						data subjects—are delineated by, and restricted to, what
						is necessary for fulfilling the Subscription Services.
						Any data processing activities falling under this
						Privacy Pledge will commence once the Creator departs
						from our platform's interface. Below, the aspects
						relating to the scope, duration, type, and purpose of
						data processing, as well as the type of personal data
						and classes of data subjects encompassed by this Privacy
						Pledge, are elaborated:
						{"\n\n"}- Subject Matter: The focal point of the data
						processing revolves around Member Information.{"\n"}-
						Duration: Data processing under this Privacy Pledge
						continues for the period during which the Creator
						retains Member Information.{"\n"}- Purpose and Nature:
						The scope and objective of data processing are confined
						to the Creator’s responsibility for executing
						Subscription Services to the Member.
						{"\n"}- Types of Data: This agreement covers personal
						details such as but not limited to, usernames, email
						addresses, mailing addresses, and subscription amounts.
						{"\n"}- Categories of Data Subjects: The data subjects
						under this Privacy Pledge are individuals who register
						for subscription-based memberships on our platform.

						Section III: Protection of User Information
					</TermsText>
					<TermsText>
						Adherence to Data Guidelines
						{"\n\n"}
						Creators are obligated to manage User Data in line with
						our Platform's Terms of Service, Privacy Guidelines, and
						this Data Protection Covenant. Processing will only be
						done to fulfill the specific instructions provided by
						us, in full compliance with relevant Data Privacy Laws.
						Creators shall not repurpose the data for their own gain
						or other unauthorized objectives. If a legal mandate
						forces the Creator to process data in another manner,
						the Creator must inform the User unless such disclosure
						is legally barred.
						{"\n\n"}
						Scope of Data Processing
						{"\n\n"}
						Creators must only handle User Data to the degree and in
						the manner essential for delivering the Subscription
						Services agreed upon.
						{"\n\n"}
						Implementing Safeguards
						{"\n\n"}
						Creators are required to apply and continually update
						suitable technical and administrative safeguards aimed
						at shielding User Data from unauthorized usage,
						inadvertent loss, or illicit alterations and
						disclosures. These protective measures should be
						consistent with both applicable Data Privacy Laws and
						recognized industry standards.
						{"\n\n"}
						Third-Party Involvement
						{"\n\n"}
						Creators may not share or outsource User Data to any
						third party, including subsidiary companies or
						subcontractors, without prior approval from us. Creators
						must evaluate and ensure the dependability and
						skillfulness of these third parties and ensure that
						their contracts include data protection clauses that are
						equivalent to those in this Data Protection Covenant.
						{"\n\n"}
						Assurance of Personnel Competency
						{"\n\n"}
						Creators should take adequate measures to verify the
						credibility and expertise of their staff Fans who have
						permission to access User Data. All such personnel must
						be educated about the confidential nature of the data
						and must adhere to the provisions of this Data
						Protection Covenant.
						{"\n\n"}
						Legal Compliance and Collaboration
						{"\n\n"}
						Creators should actively cooperate in ensuring our
						compliance with Data Privacy Laws. For instance,
						Creators should immediately inform us in writing if they
						receive any data subject requests or other
						communications, complaints, or inquiries concerning our
						data protection obligations.
						{"\n\n"}
						Data Retention and Deletion
						{"\n\n"}
						Creators must not keep User Data for longer than
						necessary for providing Subscription Services. Upon the
						completion of the Subscription Services or at the User's
						request, Creators must either securely delete the data
						or return it to the User, according to the User’s
						choice.
						{"\n\n"}
						Incident Reporting and Resolution
						{"\n\n"}
						If a Creator becomes aware of any unintended,
						unauthorized, or illegal destruction, loss,
						modification, or exposure of, or access to User Data,
						they must:
						{"\n\n"}
						1. Prompt Notification: Notify us promptly and without
						unnecessary delay, furnishing details like the nature of
						the incident, affected data, affected individuals, and
						corrective actions taken or planned. Regular updates and
						additional information may also be required.
						{"\n\n"}
						2. Prompt Investigation: Conduct an immediate
						investigation, at their own cost, to assess and mitigate
						the incident’s impact and to initiate appropriate
						recovery measures.
						{"\n\n"}
						Ongoing Compliance
						{"\n\n"}
						Creators must adhere to all relevant Data Privacy Laws
						and assist us in doing the same. They should readily
						provide information that we may request to confirm their
						compliance with this Covenant. If a Creator believes any
						data-processing instruction from us violates data
						privacy laws, they must notify us immediately.
