									This may be for a few reasons:

									1. The selfie you submitted alongside your
									government-issued ID either wasn’t provided
									or wasn’t good enough quality. The ID should
									be in color, fully visible, and not edited
									in any way. Both your face and all
									information on the ID should be easily
									readable. Images that have been edited,
									cropped, or manipulated in any way won’t be
									accepted.
									{"\n"}
									{"\n"}
									2. The cover and profile photos you’ve
									uploaded are unclear or misleading, and
									should accurately reflect the kind of
									content you’ll be posting.
									{"\n"}
									{"\n"}
									3. You can’t include other people or
									copyrighted material in your cover image or
									profile photo without written permission
									from those involved. Please replace them
									with images that comply with our Terms of
									Service and Acceptable Use Policy.
									{"\n"}
									{"\n"}
									If your application doesn’t meet all these
									criteria, we’ll need more information from
									you, and this will delay your application by
									24 to 48 hours.
